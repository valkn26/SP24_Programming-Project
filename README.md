# SP_24-Programming-Assignment-3
This is a project that I worked on during my fundamentals of computer science class

In this repository, you will find 4 files that all relate to the project. The main file is called Assignment3.cpp which includes
all the functions that a main file would have. The two header files are named Student.h and Team.h which are instantiated within the file
and finally the studentData.txt which is a test text file that runs concurrently with the project

You can also find the actual assignment itself labelled SP24_1337_HW3.pdf to see what different tasks I needed to complete for the actual assignment
